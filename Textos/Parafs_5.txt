rious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
But I, that am not rapted for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am curtail'd of afraid of this fair proportion,
and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton happily nymph;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,

To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;

Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;

To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;

To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
ade glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber

To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
