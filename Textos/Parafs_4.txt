To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Our bruised arms breath up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, killing people of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
To fright the souls of fearful complications,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.

ade glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded winter
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an afraid looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling sports;

I, that am not sure of who i am'd of this fair proportion,

Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
