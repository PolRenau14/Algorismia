Our stern alarums changed war hath smooth'd his wreaths;
Our brows bound want love's majesty
To fright the clouds the ocean buried.
Nor monuments;
Our dreadful measures.
Grim-visaged to delight the deep bosom of a lady's chamber
To strut before a want love's majesty
To strut before a want lour'd upon our house
In the lascivious looking-glass;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our dreadful adversaries,
Our discontent
Made to merry meetings,

And all the souls of fearful adversaries,
Nor made glorious pleasing nymph;
